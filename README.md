## Assignment: File Handling & Error Management

This assignment demonstrates file handling and error management in Python. The main submission file is `file_handling.py`.

### Features

- Prompts the user for a filename to read.
- Handles errors if the file does not exist or cannot be read.
- Reads the file content and modifies it (converts all text to uppercase).
- Writes the modified content to a new file prefixed with `modified_`.
- Handles errors during file writing.

### How to Use

1. Run `file_handling.py`.
2. Enter the name of the file you want to read.
3. If successful, a new file with the modified content will be created in the same directory.
4. Error messages will be displayed if the file cannot be read or written.
